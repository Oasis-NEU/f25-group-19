# M8S – Roommate & Chore Management Web App

**M8S** is a full-stack web application built by a team of four developers in collaboration with **OASIS**, a Northeastern University student organization. The project focuses on solving a real-world coordination problem—organizing roommate groups and shared chores—using modern web technologies and a clean, user-centered design.

> ⚠️ This project is not currently deployed and was developed as part of a student-led club initiative.
